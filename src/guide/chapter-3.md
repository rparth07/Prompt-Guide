# Chapter 3: Prompt Engineering for NLP Tasks

## Leveraging prompts for natural language processing tasks

Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Some common NLP tasks where prompts are utilized include:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Prompt the model to analyze the sentiment of given texts as positive, negative, or neutral.

**Example:**
```
Prompt: Analyze the sentiment of the following text: 'The movie was fantastic, and the acting was superb!'
Model completion: Positive.
```

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Prompt the model to identify and classify entities (e.g., names, locations, organizations) in a given text.

**Example:**
```
Prompt: Identify the named entities in the following sentence: 'Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino, California.'
Model completion: Entities: ['Apple Inc.', 'Steve Jobs', 'Cupertino', 'California']
```

3. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Prompt the model to label each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).

**Example:**
```
Prompt: Provide the POS tags for the sentence: 'The cat jumps over the fence.'
Model completion: Tags: ['Determiner', 'Noun', 'Verb', 'Adverb', 'Determiner', 'Noun', 'Punctuation']
```

## Advanced techniques for prompt adaptation across different NLP tasks

To effectively adapt prompts for different NLP tasks, consider the following techniques:

1. **Modifying Prompts**: Adjust prompts to suit the specific requirements of each task, such as adding constraints or changing the question format.

**Example:**
```
Original prompt: Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello.'
Modified prompt: Translate the English phrase 'Hello, how are you?' to French.
```

2. **Task-Specific Vocabulary**: Tailor prompts to include domain-specific or task-specific vocabulary to improve task comprehension.

**Example:**
```
Original prompt: Translate the medical report.
Task-specific prompt: Translate the medical report related to cardiac ailments and treatment options.
```

## Prompting in Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a given text. To construct an effective prompt for sentiment analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Task**: Clearly specify that the model should perform sentiment analysis.

**Example:**
```
Prompt: Analyze the sentiment of the following review: 'The new restaurant has excellent service and delicious food.'
```

## Prompting in Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition involves identifying and classifying entities in a given text. Constructing a prompt for NER involves:

1. **Providing Context**: Specify that the model should look for named entities.

**Example:**
```
Prompt: Identify the named entities in the following news article about technology advancements: 'Apple Inc. announced the launch of its latest iPhone model yesterday.'
```

## Prompting in Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

POS tagging involves labeling each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech. Design an effective prompt for POS tagging:

1. **Question Format**: Use a question format to prompt the model for POS tagging.

**Example:**
```
Prompt: What are the part-of-speech tags for the sentence: 'The cat jumps over the fence?'
```
